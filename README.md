# Getting Started with Siding Puzzle

### `git clone`

    Clone the application to your machine

### `npm install`

    This will load all necessary third party modules that this app requires

### `npm start`

    After a succesful install of the node modules you can run this script in the terminal inside the root directory to start up the app locally

# Time to Play

    All you need to do now is select an image and a difficulty then press the start button.

    When you are in the game it displays the goal image and you can click start to shuffle the tiles.

    When you have started you can reset the image to its goal state and then click start to reshuffle.

    At any time you can click "CHOOSE AN IMAGE" to select a new image and change the difficulty.

# Changes if I had more time

    1. If I had some more time I would implement a better theme for Material UI to make the style flow a bit better.

    1. Use JSS instead of CSS.

    2. I could manage the tiles in the Context API instead of in the Board Component.

    3. Implement some css to make the tiles slide into the empty space and look more appealing to the eye.

    4. Clean up some code (put some inline styles that need to be moved to classes)

    5. Of course come up with a better name!
